# Interactive Plotly Presentation
Autor: Aprameya Nayak
Date: 5th November 2024

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive web page presentation using R Markdown that visualizes the relationship between car weight and miles per gallon (MPG) across different gear types. By utilizing the Plotly library, this project aims to enhance data exploration and storytelling, allowing users to interact with the visualizations dynamically.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the built-in `mtcars` dataset in R, which contains various characteristics of automobiles. The dataset includes attributes such as car weight (in 1000 lbs), miles per gallon (MPG), and the number of gears in each vehicle. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into how car weight affects fuel efficiency across different gear configurations.

## About Plotly
Plotly is a powerful graphing library that allows users to create interactive plots and visualizations in R (and other programming languages). With Plotly, users can easily explore data through zooming, panning, and hovering over data points to reveal more information. This interactivity makes it an excellent tool for data presentation and exploration, especially in web-based environments.
