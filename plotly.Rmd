## Introduction

This project was created as part of the Developing Data Products course. It showcases an interactive plot created using Plotly in R Markdown, and the resulting webpage is hosted with a dark theme. The `mtcars` dataset includes various characteristics of cars, such as weight, MPG, and gear type. Below, weâ€™ll explore the relationship between car weight and MPG by gear type. The plot shows car weight versus MPG with points color-coded by the number of gears (3, 4, or 5). 


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Load required libraries
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Prepare the data
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(gear = factor(gear, labels = c("3 gears", "4 gears", "5 gears")))

# Create interactive plot with CSS styling
p <- plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, color = ~gear, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(
    title = "Car Weight vs. MPG by Gear Type",
    xaxis = list(title = "Weight (1000 lbs)"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Miles per Gallon (MPG)")
  )
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
p
```
